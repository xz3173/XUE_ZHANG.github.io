We're making interactive plots

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)

library(plotly)
```

```{r}
data("instacart")
```


# Scatterplot
Let's make a scatterplot to show that the most common aisles are more likely to be reordered from!
```{r}
# Summarizing the data by aisle_id
summary_data = instacart |>
  group_by(aisle_id, aisle) |>
  summarize(
    total_orders = n(),
    avg_reordered_rate = mean(reordered, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) |>
  arrange(-total_orders) 

# Plotting the data
summary_data |>
  plot_ly(x = ~aisle,
          y = ~avg_reordered_rate,
          text = ~aisle,
          type = "scatter",
          mode = "markers") |>
  layout(title = "Relationship between Aisle Popularity and Reorder Rate",
         xaxis = list(title = "Aisles (Ordered by Popularity)"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Average Reorder Rate"))
```




# Box plot
Let's make a box plot to show that the time of day that users purchase specific products!

```{r}
# Define a threshold for popular products, for example, the top 30
top_n_products = 30

# Extract the most popular products
popular_products = instacart |>
  count(product_id, product_name) |>
  arrange(-n) |>
  slice_head(n = top_n_products) |>
  pull(product_name)

# Filter the main data for only popular products
filtered_data = instacart |>
  filter(product_name %in% popular_products)

# Plotting the data using plotly
plot_ly(data = filtered_data,
        x = ~order_hour_of_day,
        y = ~product_name, 
        type = "box",
        colors = "viridis") |>
  
  layout(title = "Distribution of Purchase Hours for Popular Products",
         xaxis = list(title = "Hour of Day"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Product"))

```


# Bar plot
Let's make a bar plot to show that aisles with with more than 10000 items ordered!

```{r}
# filtering aisles with more than 10000 items ordered
instacart |>
  group_by(aisle) |>
  summarise(order_count = n()) |>
  filter(order_count > 10000) |>
  arrange(order_count) |>

# plotting
  plot_ly(
    x = ~aisle,
    y = ~order_count,
    type = "bar",
    colors = "viridis") |>
  layout(title = "Nubmer of Items Ordered in Each Aisle",
         xaxis = list(title = "Aisle"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Nuber of Items Ordered"))
```
