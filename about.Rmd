# About Myself

My name is Xue Zhang, and a student who majors in biostatistics at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. I played the bamboo flute since I was in elementary school – for about 15 years. Until recently, I did not discover the Kalimba – the covid pandemic attack on the world. I love to learn many different instruments, and though I try many of them, the Kalimba is my favorite. It is the most accessible instrument that I have practiced, and it is also the instrument that I enjoyed most.
